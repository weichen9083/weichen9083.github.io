First impression of this project was that it was gonna be easy and quite simple, i was completely wrong. In comparison to the first CLI project, the sinatra project was a pretty big jump. I was dealing less with elementary methods but more so on framework structure. My initial imprssion while reading the requirement was that it is going to be very straight forward, only when i started laying out the building blocks did the whole thing become more and more complicated.  

The biggest thing i learn while doing this project was to take thing one at a time, don’t try to do the whole project in a big picture kind of way.  The first thing I did was the front page and the the signup and login form, that was very simple until I realize i needed to add in more code to take more into all possible scenarios from the user. After that was creating route and erb for different page and function. I realize keeping the structure organized is very important or else you will be doing a lot of tedious searching.  In addition during this project ‘pry’ was a huge help with output, i can easily check the hash params with it.
