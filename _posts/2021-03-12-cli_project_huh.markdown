This is my first project and it took me a long time to get here. My first impression of the project was how am I suppose to tackle this project. This is the first time I was given free rein, no more step by step instructions or requirements.  I can choose anything I want, it is exciting and at the same time overwhelming. 

I decided to base the project on an anime review website call random curiosity (url:www.randomc.net).  This was a website I frequented often during my high school years, I was a big anime fan back in the day.  So I decided to combine two things I like into one, 

For this project I decided I will be scraping the winter preview page, I will create a bunch of anime object with different properties from the data I scrap from the website. Then manipulate the data and present it to the end user.  I have a general idea how to structure the project but it turn out to be a lot harder to start than I thought.  Luckily, the video provided was extremely helpful, I realize trying to structure the whole project wasn’t gonna work. I should just start and work my way up one step at a time.  Since this is my first project I don’t think it will be that great but I think it will serve as a reflection point in the future. I will come back to this project in the future and realize how much I had improved
